//! The Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP).
//!
//! Note that LE and Classic Bluetooth differ quite a bit on this layer, even though they're
//! supposed to share L2CAP. We're only implementing the LE bits.
//!
//! L2CAP provides "channels" to the upper layers that are mapped to the physical transport below
//! the L2CAP layer (the LE Link Layer or whatever Classic Bluetooth does). A channel is identified
//! by a 16-bit ID (also see [`Channel`]), a few of which are reserved.
//!
//! A minimal implementation for Classic Bluetooth must support the L2CAP signaling channel
//! (`0x0001`). A minimal implementation for BLE has to support the L2CAP LE signaling channel
//! (`0x0005`), the Attribute Protocol channel (`0x0004`), and the LE Security Manager channel
//! (`0x0006`).
//!
//! Establishing new connection-oriented channels, as well as transferring data over the
//! connectionless channel (`0x0002`) makes use of *Protocol/Service Multiplexers* (PSMs), which are
//! numbers identifying the protocol or service to use. These numbers are either defined by the
//! Bluetooth SIG or allocated dynamically for use with the Service Discovery Protocol (SDP). The
//! preallocated numbers are hosted online [here][l2c].
