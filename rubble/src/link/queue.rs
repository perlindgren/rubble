//! An SPSC queue for data channel PDUs.
//!
//! Data channel PDUs are received and transmitted in time-critical code, so they're sent through
//! a queue to be processed at a later time (eg. in the application's idle loop).
//!
//! This module defines the following important items:
//!
//! * The [`PacketQueue`] trait, which is implemented by all types providing a packet queue. A type
//!   implementing this trait is needed to use the Rubble stack.
//! * The [`Producer`] and [`Consumer`] traits, which define the queue functionality used after
//!   splitting a [`PacketQueue`].
//! * The [`SimpleQueue`], [`SimpleProducer`] and [`SimpleConsumer`] types, a minimal implementation
//!   of the queue interface defined by [`PacketQueue`], [`Producer`] and [`Consumer`].
//!
